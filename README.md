# 4-Gradient-operator
The gradient operator is fundamental in edge detection, as it quantifies the rate of intensity change in an image.
It highlights sharp transitions, such as object boundaries, by emphasizing regions where pixel intensities change significantly in a given direction. The gradient is calculated for both horizontal and vertical directions, and the combined gradient magnitude can be used to detect edges.

4-1: Gradient Operator in Image Processing
Overview
The gradient operator in image processing is a tool used to detect edges by highlighting regions where the intensity of the image changes rapidly. It measures the rate of intensity change in both horizontal and vertical directions to identify significant transitions in pixel intensity.

4-2: Roberts Operator
Overview
The Roberts Operator is a simple edge detection technique used in image processing. It highlights regions with rapid intensity changes by computing the gradient of the image at each pixel. The Roberts operator is particularly sensitive to fine details, but its small 2x2 convolution kernels make it more vulnerable to noise compared to other operators like the Sobel operator.
